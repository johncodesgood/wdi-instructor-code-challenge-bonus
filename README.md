WDI Instructor Code Challenge - AngularFire
==============

Advantages and challenges of students learning AngularJS
--------------

Students can benefit from learning frameworks like Angular because they allow the students
to quickly get an application up and running. By reducing some of the more tedious
coding required to build an app, students can spend more of their time focusing 
on the specific topic they are trying to learn (i.e. accessing APIs, login/authentication, etc). 

However, there is also a downside to this. If students haven't yet learned
the fundamentals of web programming, then they won't fully understand how the framework
is working behing the scenes. This may make it more difficult for them to debug
issues with their code and truley understand when to use certain frameworks over others. 
Another challenge for students may be in learning the more complex features of a framework 
(such as directives in AngularJS) which may overly complicate their learning and even
overwhlem them.

The best approach is for students to first learn the basics of web programming (DOM manipulation,
databases, and MVC). Once they understand the details of how these work, then they can start using new frameworks/libraries to create apps more efficiently.
